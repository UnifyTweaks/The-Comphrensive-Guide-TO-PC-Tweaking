In THE PC Tweaking Community, many people often find themselves lost when it comes to understanding how to properly tweak their pc. This has led to the emergence of countless "tweak sellers," individuals who claim to be experts at optimizing computer performance but often charge exorbitant fees for their services. In order to combat this problem, I have decided to create a comprehensive PC tweaking guide, with the aim of helping people avoid getting scammed by these so-called "experts." that sell public and garbage tweaks majority of the time. THIS Guide will include everything from start to finish on how to properly optimize your PC for the best perfomance you can obtain while still having system compatibility.
